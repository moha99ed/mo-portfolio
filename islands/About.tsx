        I have a strong passion for creating innovative solutions that make a difference. My love for web development began when I created my first website using HTML and CSS, and I haven't stopped since.

        In addition to my web development experience, I have a background in physics, which has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and critical thinking.

        When I'm not coding, you can find me playing 8 ball pool or petanque with friends. I believe in a work-life balance and that taking breaks is essential for creativity.

        Please feel free to explore my portfolio to see my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate. Let's connect and make a difference together!
